🚀 New Project : Sales & Product Analysis Dashboard with Power BI 📊

I recently completed a data-driven Sales Analysis project where I explored key business insights such as:

✅ Product-wise sales performance
✅ Revenue trends and top-performing items
✅ Regional and time-based sales patterns
✅ KPIs like total revenue, sales growth, and average order value

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that helps visualize complex data in a simple, actionable way — ideal for business decision-making and performance tracking. 🔍📈

This project sharpened my skills in data modeling, DAX, and storytelling through visuals — and I'm excited to apply these insights in real-world business environments!

💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions. Let’s connect and talk data!
